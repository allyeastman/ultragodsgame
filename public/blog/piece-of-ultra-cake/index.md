Making a good game is a lot like baking a cake. It’s important to include tasty ingredients to create a robust and memorable flavour. Don’t forget the frosting and decorations; as the visual impact is the first flavour that’s tasted. <!-- more --> At first thought it may sound easy to throw together the most tasty ingredients you can think of and just pile on the frosting with lashings of decorative candy. Wow, job done! But what you’ll probably end up with is something like this:

This analogy may seem like a long shot but it certainly rings true to me in many areas of game development. Finding the right balance of substance to wow factor is a tricky juggling act. A lot of cool and crazy ideas can come out of a group of talented creatives, but it’s deciding what will stay in the game that really makes the cake! Keeping it tame enough but still slapping the face with some wow factor can produce something more like this:

I am happy to say that we have pulled our deliciously balanced cake out of the oven and are well into decorating. The art team have hit warp speed, producing some tasty impressions thus far. As project manager and vision holder it is imperative that I keep this train on its track and heading towards our desired goal. We don’t want to rock up to the birthday party with a carrot cake… even though I really like carrot cake, (Flips table) that’s not ULTRA!!!

While the guys are making the pretties I am going to continue to tweak the finer details of the mechanics to make sure it feels the part. In the coming weeks, leading up to release, we will be attempting to break the game in order to resolve any bugs that are lurking beneath the surface (which there always are). We don’t want to make our players sick by finding a hair or band-aid in their cake.

You better get a dessert plate and a napkin because you’re in for a treat of ULTRA proportions.

Something Ultra is baking…..
