With the production stage of Ultra Gods in full swing, now is a great time to talk about some of the things that have been happening behind the scenes. Ultra Gods has had a lot of iterations in the background, lots of things added, lots of things culled, trying to get into that sweet spot that we can all appreciate in terms of what can be designed, and what is practical. <!-- more --> My name is Jamie Proudlock, and I’m the Level and Audio Designer for Sweaty Yeti.

 

In the last few weeks we’ve been making some huge changes to what we originally had. We wanted to create something “Ultra”, a word you will most likely be hearing a lot of throughout these blogs. Our first attempts saw us creating huge levels that resembled a 3D first person shooter layout in a 2D platformer format. It meant we could go overboard with what we wanted in the levels, how the levels reacted to player interaction, literally thousands of different reflection points for the discs and so on. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what happened, we went overboard.

 

We playtested a couple of ideas that we had, created multiple levels on paper, but it all seemed a little too big. As it’s only a four player game without AI, it took far too much time for the players to actually interact. This was a problem, as our main focus was to make a 2D brawler type of game that was fast paced and chaotic, we wanted to have a steep learning curve so that it’s easy to land kills on other players, but a well versed player could take out multiple players while being agile enough to dodge other players attacks. This meant that the large levels had to go.

 

We decided on making things smaller, taking notes from games like Super Smash Bros, Towerfall, and even fighting games like Lethal League and Street Fighter. Smash Bros., in particular, struck a chord with me. They have 4 players on the screen at any one time, but the levels are broken up and were large enough to accommodate such fast paced games, rounds would last anywhere from 3 minutes to 20 minutes all on one level that would have a singular platform in the middle. Not just that, but these levels translated through each iteration of the Smash Bros. franchise, returning in each sequel without any changes. These levels, while simple, stood the test of time, and that’s something I aim to achieve with Ultra Gods.

 

As of now, we are in full swing, and we’ve begun the actual building stage of the levels. There will need to be fine tuning and changes made, that’s a given in this kind of work, nothing ever works the way you want it to the first time. However, I’m confident that what we’re doing now will engage the players, you guys, and will bring that sweet Ultra-ness of close quarters combat that we all love.
Until then, something Ultra is coming.
