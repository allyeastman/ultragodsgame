Welcome to the first of many development blogs from the team at Sweaty Yeti for our debut release Ultra Gods! Over the coming months we’ll be sharing insights into our development process as well each of the team’s creative drive and personality. <!-- more --> I have the pleasure of shedding the first light on the game and what we’re planning to unleash unto this world. Cue thunder and dramatic instrumental build up!!!

 

But before I get carried away with the exciting details let me first introduce myself. My name is Jim Vincent, I am the Project Manager and sole programmer for Ultra Gods. Like my fellow peers I am a student nearing the completion of a bachelor degree at SAE Institute in the glorious city of Brisbane, Australia. I am studying game design specializing in programming to equip myself with the fundamental tools to unleash my creative drive to entertain the masses via video game development.

 

The word <<ULTRA>> mostly sums up both the visual feel and play style we are aiming for. Players can expect juiced visual and sound effects to be flooding their living rooms. Four futuristic characters face off against each other to claim superiority in a multiplayer arena battle of ultra proportions. Armed with only a throwing disc; each player must aim sharp or use the rebound nature of the disc to vanquish his or her foe. However, the upside of being a god is immortality right? So why not respawn back into the action in an instant and avenge yourself! Ultra Gods gameplay is fast paced and deaths are relentless; inspired by multiplayer games like Call of Duty and the classic Bomberman,  you can expect intense short rounds battles of skill and strategy.

 

Right now you might be trying to imagine a ‘first person shooter’ with only a throwing disc in your hands, but alas you can take a refreshing breath of relief. Ultra Gods is a 2D platformer! With our debut title we are trying to rekindle the nostalgia of multiplayer games by bringing it back to a local environment. Sitting on the couch with friends and driving friendly, and sometimes furious, competition with the people right next to you. Not to worry though, it’s not four player split screen; everyone plays within the same screen.

 

The planning stage is under wraps and production is smashed into gear and gaining momentum. With that said, that’s all I can divulge on at this point, but we’ll post another blog soon. So prepare yourself!
Something ULTRA is coming…
